Grouped in a the namespace 'Web', all the route requests are directed to the folder web located at:

```
App > Http > Controllers > Web
```
A request is handled by a controller class method which returns a rendered html view.

#### Web route
```
http://laravel.test/users
```
In the web.php route file, we would define the route above as:

```
Route::group(['namespace' => 'Web'], function() {
    Route::get('/users', [RouteController::class, 'viewMethod'])->name('users.index');
});
```

Defining the routes into nested groups is essential to allow the proper scaling of a project.

#### Route nested groups
```
Route::group(['namespace' => 'Web', function() {
    
    ... list of guest routes
    
    Route::group([
        'middleware' => 'auth',
    ], function() { 
        ... list of authenticated routes
    });
});
```

#### Catch all route

Placed at the end of the web routes file, a catch all route definition will be capturing all non defined route requests and routing them to a controller class.

```
Route::get('/{method?}', function ($method = null) {

        $pageController = app()->make(PageController::class);

        if ($method !== null) {
            return $pageController->{$method}();
        }
    });
```
The catch all definition is an appropriate solution when the routing is handled by a Javascript library (Vue or React router).
